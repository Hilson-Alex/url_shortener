# SQLite URL Shortener

This project is a low config url shortener made for hobby. It uses a SQLite database hosted at an auto created .db file, so the only thing you need to do to run is... run it.


## Getting Started

By following these instructions you will get the server running on your local machine. 


### Installing

// To be defined


### Cloning and Building

To get the repository running locally on your machine you will need to install the [Go compiler](https://go.dev/dl/)

You can clone the project by running

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Hilson-Alex/url_shortener.git
```

or, if you can't use ssh

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Hilson-Alex/url_shortener.git
```

Next, open the project folder and run:

```shell
go run .
```

Or, you can build the binary instead:

```shell
go build
```

And then you will have a `url_shortener.exe` on the root folder.
